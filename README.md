You are tasked with building a social networking platform that allows users to 
create profiles, connect with other users, and share posts. The platform should 
have the following features:
User registration and login:
Users should be able to create accounts and login to the platform.
Passwords should be encrypted and stored securely.
Users should be able to edit their profile information.
Profiles:
Users should be able to create profiles, which should include a 
profile picture, bio, and links to their other social media accounts.
Users should be able to view the profiles of other users.
Posts:
Users should be able to create posts, which should include text 
and images.
Users should be able to like, comment on, and share posts.
Users should be able to search for posts by keyword.
Connections:
Users should be able to connect with other users and view their 
posts in a feed.
Users should be able to see a list of their connections and manage 
their connections.
The platform should be built using Python (preferably in Django) and any 
relevant frameworks or libraries. It should be designed to be scalable, easy to 
maintain, and customizable. You may use any packages you deem necessary.
Being the backend developer,
(1) You are required to analyze the required features and figure out the needed 
routes
(2) Develop the backend using Django and MongoDB. You then have to upload 
the codebase to GitHub and share the repository link. Also, share the .env file 
separately.
(3) Prepare and share with us a comprehensive Postman collection with all the 
routes documented
